{"article": "The man is said to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee that is investigating claims of US espionage. German authorities have asked the US ambassador for \"swift clarification\". The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme. The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst. The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details. A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany.\"The matter is serious, it is clear,\" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money.

{"article": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill. Last year \u00a33.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by \u00a31bn by the end of this financial year. A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved \u00a3600m, the regulator said. It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted. The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them. Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in. NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short. The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be. And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen. The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime. NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year. Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work. It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted \u00a3130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be \u00a376, while another was quoted \u00a370 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be \u00a335.

World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game'How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital \"trampled all human values\".\"In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,\" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors\". One employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.\"The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to \"avenge the blood of our people\". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.

As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.

Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach.

It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule.

In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven't got a suitable area to spend a penny. Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet?\"Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres, cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory. Lorna Fillingham, mother of six-year-old Emily-May, is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory\"It's like playing Russian roulette,\" Lorna says. \"Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful.\"My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty.\"Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people.

In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy. A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks. These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation. Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history. In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device World champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops. The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap. The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa. Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship. The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four. By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions. Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat. Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit. Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: \"If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo.\"Kvyat replied: \"We didn't crash.\" Vettel responded: \"You didn't. You were lucky this time.\" Kvyat shrugged: \"I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.\"In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: \"You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.\"Listen to Vettel's post-race rant At the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner. In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass. Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front. Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance. Listen to the first-lap madness Hamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race. So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart. He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.\"The car was pretty damaged,\" said the 31-year-old afterwards. \"I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.\"Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a \"lot of aerodynamic performance\".

Global solidarity over Aleppo How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo What's happening in Aleppo?What happens next?The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed.\"Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,\" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left.\"No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,\" she added. The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province. US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out \"nothing short of a massacre\" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva.\"The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,\" he said in Washington. John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks. But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. \"You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,\" he told me. Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith. Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - \"delusional diplomacy\", the Washington Post called it. Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one. Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city. A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo. The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed. As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured. The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances. Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal. The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: \"A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.\"\"This corridor is 21km long,\" he said, adding, \"6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.\"Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. In a televised address, he said Turkey would take \"children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions\". The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred. UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.\"If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,\" he told reporters in Paris. The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members. Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages. Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years. In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be \"the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists\", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters. He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.

Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance. Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236. Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002. They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover. But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary. Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes. After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning. Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.

She was jailed for six years after a trial that included allegations that she had supplied children as young as 13 to her clients. Fourteen years later Forde was prosecuted and jailed again for inciting prostitution. Richard Griffiths, Forde's solicitor in 1992, has now spoken on her behalf to the Salisbury Journal.

{"article": "That report was never written, but the murdered opposition politician's colleagues, led by his close associate Ilya Yashin, have since worked to finish it. Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are \"volunteers\". But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk.\"All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,\" he said.\"The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.\"The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month.

But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful.

Anyone running illegal schools could face a jail term of up to 51 weeks. Ministers are also consulting on plans for more regulation of places teaching for more than 6 to 8 hours a week. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools in England, told the BBC this week that his inspectors were visibly shocked by the conditions they found. It is understood that a total of 18 unregulated schools, mainly in Muslim communities in the Midlands, have been visited as part of an investigation in recent months. Three places in Birmingham have been closed and the owners are being investigated under suspicion of running an illegal school. Sir Michael said the cases uncovered were likely to be the \"tip of the iceberg\" and he was seriously concerned that children were at risk of being abused or radicalised. Any place where children are taught for more than 20 hours a week has to register as a school. Some places describing themselves as part-time education centres or \"flexi schools\"  are operating within the law providing support for home-educated children. But Ofsted and ministers are concerned that some are taking advantage of the legal right to home educate to operate what are in fact illegal schools. In a letter to the education secretary on Friday, Sir Michael suggested officials had been slow to take decisive action in the three places which Ofsted had closed with the help of the local council.\"This was achieved in spite of your officials providing, what I believe to be, confusing and unhelpful advice to the proprietors that they could now apply to register their provision.\"The government has provided funding for a team of six inspectors whose job will be to investigate illegal schools.

{"article": "Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel Mc Cann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr Mc Cann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.

{"article": "Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than \u00a34m to \u00a325.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was \"staggered\" by the \"incomprehensible\" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of \u00a3345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - \u00a32m less than the record \u00a3347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has \"confirmed its commitment\" for Tokyo 2020. He added: \"These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained.\"Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given \u00a35.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a \"catastrophic impact on the sport\" and Badminton England would \"fight for the hopes and dreams\" of its players.\"How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?\" he said.\"What have we done wrong?\" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly.\"We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,\" she said.\"If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk.\"Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: \"UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020.\"Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build \"performance pathways for future success\" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: \"It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review.\"With UK Sport's investment budget approaching \u00a3350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport.\"UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed.

{"article": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise \u00a34.5bn a year. That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\".\"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.\"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already.\"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.\"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently.\"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\"But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\"He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry.'Lucky family'Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to \u00a3159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than \u00a370bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising \u00a35.5bn a year. The figure would stand at \u00a34.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.\"That seems fairer to me,\" he added. The think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.'Dramatic erosion'Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\". Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor. Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's \u00a38bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power. Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists. They included investing \u00a319.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\".

Contracts were to be signed on Friday. But Business Secretary Greg Clark has said the government will \"consider carefully\" before backing it. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has cancelled a trip to Hinkley Point on Friday following Mr Clark's comments. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. They are also concerned that the plant is being built by foreign governments. One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors. Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project. This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact. EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished. Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy?Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible.\"We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,\" he said.\"Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.\"Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was \"yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties\". Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as \"a unique asset for French and British industries\", saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment. However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity. Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners. Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project. Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was \"very risky\" financially. Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself.5,600workers on site at peak4,000km electrical cabling230,000 tonnes of steel5.6m cubic metres of earth to be moved Environmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: \"Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money. He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, \"doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians\". The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind.

Critics have raised concerns about environmental damage, potential escalating costs, and foreign investment.\n4. Chinese investors are providing one third of the project's cost.\n5. The government's decision to review the project has caused uncertainty and potential delays.\n6. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision quickly to avoid energy supply issues and high costs.\n7. Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation, called the government's decision a \"blow\" to the project.\n8. Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement.\n9. EDF has faced financial challenges and had to raise money from its owners to pay for the project.\n10. Environmentalists, including Greenpeace, have criticized the project and called for more investment in renewable energy.\n11. The Hinkley Point project has a long history, with the government proposing nuclear power as part of the future energy mix in 2006 and construction approved in 2013.\n12. The UK government agreed to pay \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour for electricity produced at the Somerset site in 2013, around double the current market rate at the time.\n13. EDF signed an investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) in 2015.\n14. The UK government postponed a final decision on the project until autumn in 2016."}

Steve Jobs had just unveiled the i Phone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the i Phone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the i Phone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an i Phone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the i Phone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the i Phone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.

{"article": "But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an i Pad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\". The benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.\"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.", "hash": "30216408", "summary": " 1.

In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced. The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations. Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or \"community payback\" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage. Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014. Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report. The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement. Some of the problems identified were:Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs. They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as \"community payback\". It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a \"tough\" alternative to imprisonment. When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and \"were determined to... desist from future offending\". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that \"match the circumstances of the offender\". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a \"wasted opportunity\".\"Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court.\"He called for \"urgent remedial action\". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted \"much more effective rehabilitation\" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not.\"It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts.\"We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them.\"", "hash": "35278963", "summary": " 1.

Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - i Wonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\"The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart.\"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.

{"article": "Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.\"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDo S) attack.\"DDo S attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as Pay Pal and Web Money. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\"Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break. Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time. Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack. Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't. The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline. The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin. Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell. The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw. The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality. Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though. Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: \"It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.\"In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.\"But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.\"I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him.

So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.\"Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger.

{"article": "Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar was performing in the country's capital Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place. Russian news reports said he was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face. The Russian embassy said it was investigating, but called local press reports \"distorted\". The rapper had taken to the stage in a red deel - a Mongolian robe - embroidered with a swastika. Though associated with the Nazis, the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler. Mr Sukhbaatar's father, Sevjidiin Sukhbaatar, told a news conference that his son spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating.\"My son was hit in the face several times with a metal object and was seriously injured. His brain was seriously hurt,\" he said. Mr Sukhbaatar displayed a book of traditional swastika patterns to emphasise that it is not a hate symbol in his country. The Russian official accused of attacking the rapper has not been identified. In a statement, the Russian embassy said it was investigating press and social media reports of the assault.\"According to our preliminary information,\" it said, the reports were \"distorted, particularly about the date, the number of participants and the circumstances of the accident\". Tens of millions of Soviet citizens died fighting the forces of Nazi Germany during World War Two. The swastika is believed to have originated in India thousands of years ago, and was used in Mongolia as a symbol of eternity centuries before the Third Reich. Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar - who is known as Amraa and is the lead singer of the band Khar Sarnai [Black Rose] - frequently wears the symbol on stage, and his songs often refer to his country's history, culture and identity. The swastika is also used by groups on Mongolia's far-right however. The musician's lawyer, father, and a band member denied reports on social media that he shouted \"Heil Hitler\" at the show. Lawyer Gankhuugiin Batbayar said the suspect in the beating had not been arrested, adding: \"[He] must be investigated according to Mongolian law, no matter his status or immunity as a diplomat\". A police spokesman told the AFP news agency that the case was under investigation.\"The suspect is a Russian diplomatic officer and the reason he wasn't kept in detention is the injury is not serious,\" he said.\"It's not true that the suspect wasn't arrested because of diplomatic immunity.\"", "hash": "38181139", "summary": " 1.

Microsoft paid $2.5bn (\u00c2\u00a31.8bn) for Mojang, Minecraft's Swedish creator, in 2014. And late last year, it bought the four-year-old Minecraft Edu version of the game from Finland-based independent developer Teacher Gaming. It is now promising to add features, but schools may face extra costs. It says more than 7,000 classrooms around the world already use Minecraft in some form.\"Teachers are using Minecraft to do so many things, including teaching maths, science, religion and poetry,\" Anthony Salcito, Microsoft's vice-president of worldwide education, told the BBC.\"Once we make the tools easier for schools to get access to and employ, I think you'll see that number [of classrooms] grow quite quickly.\"Minecraft Edu already allows teachers to modify content in the game and use a shared library of education-themed assets. Microsoft is promising to improve the experience by:To access the service, children and teachers each need their own Office 365 ID, which can also be used to provide access to the Microsoft's cloud-based productivity software. Microsoft says this will help teachers minimise the number of online accounts they need to manage. But it may also help the company promote its word processing, email, and file-sharing apps over rival services from Google and others. Microsoft intends to charge an annual fee of $5 (\u00c2\u00a33.50) for each teacher and child. That could prove more expensive than the current basic set-up, where schools pay a one-off fee of $14 multiplied by the maximum number of people they want to be able to log in at once, plus an additional $41 for server software.\"We believe we are bringing added value,\" said Deirdre Quarnstrom, director of Minecraft education.\"On top of having a persistent identity, they will also have access to the most current version of the game.\"Minecraft Edu, along with other Minecraft mods, was one to two releases behind by nature of the development process.\"We are also replacing the need for schools to have and maintain separate server hardware.\"The new features were welcomed by Leigh Wolmarans, the head teacher of Lings Primary School in Northampton. His school already uses Minecraft Edu to teach pupils about A Midsummer Night's Dream by asking them to create a performance of Shakespeare's play within the game. However, he said other teachers should be aware the software had its limitations.\"Technology can lead to exceptional learning, but it has to be used in conjunction with other tools,\" he said.\"If all you are doing is sitting them down and leaving them to experience Shakespeare through Minecraft, you would be doing something wrong.\"Dance, art, drama and music remain the best ways to teach kids.\"But technology can add to that as an additional tool.\"Microsoft said it would allow teachers to start \"beta-testing\" Minecraft's education edition at some point \"in the summer\" without charge, ahead of its formal rollout.", "hash": "35341528", "summary": " Microsoft, the owner of Minecraft since 2014, recently acquired Minecraft Edu, an education-focused version of the game, from Teacher Gaming.

{"article": "As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football.\"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,\" he said.\"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper.\"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\"He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from Po W camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.\"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\"E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.\"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said.\"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.\"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\"But when the British Po Ws were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.\"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said.\"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.\"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.\"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.\"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\"Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.\"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said.\"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.\"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\"\"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.\"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\"As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied Po Ws.\"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\"\"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\"Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.\"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said.\"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year.

{"article": "Pro-Kremlin party A Just Russia put forward both bills, and linked them directly to the situation in Ukraine. Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new \"subject\" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart.\"In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,\" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed \"at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',\" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

{"article": "As Nadir Ciftci sloped off to Eskisehirspor on loan, fellow forward Colin Kazim-Richards, formerly of Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, arrived from Feyenoord just as his suspension for threatening a journalist came to an end. Whether or not either Turk will delight enough to be hits with their new clubs, it is another loanee who has the potential to set Celtic Park alight if he lives up to his market value. Patrick Roberts moved to Manchester City in the summer for about \u00a312m and the 18-year-old winger has 18 months with the reigning Scottish champions in which to prove himself worthy of the fee paid to Fulham. Kazim-Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble, not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals, and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the \u00a31.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender. Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie. The Dandies' deadline-day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 finals squad. However, the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek Mc Innes thought necessary. While they brought in two replacements, the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run.

The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with Abiola Dauda, a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record.

{"article": "The hosts claimed Australia's last five wickets for 44 runs on Friday morning to bowl them out for 308 and secure a first-innings lead of 122. Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd. And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale, Mark Wood's unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win. Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs, with Australia's best effort the 404-3 by Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' at Headingley in 1948. England set the tone for a near-perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning, executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings. Shane Watson's vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps. James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc, with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between. In little more than an hour, England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control. After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22-2 - their second innings found momentum. Adam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37, but the main catalyst was Bell, who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half-century. The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off, lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third-man boundary with his trademark late cut. He reached fifty off 75 balls, and underlined his new-found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four. The next ball brought Bell's undoing however, as, clearly expecting the short ball, he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match. By the time of Bell's dismissal, England were flying and the in-form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne, with both finding the boundary nine times. A mini-collapse from 207-4 to 245-8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope, only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source. Swinging from the hip, Wood took the lead role in a 43-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Moeen Ali and was still at the crease when Anderson became Lyon's fourth victim in the very last action of the day. England's brilliance has set up the possibility of a four-day finish, and the hosts would be wise to do their utmost to wrap things up on Saturday because of heavy showers forecast for Sunday. Australia will no doubt still fancy their chances of pulling off a record-breaking victory, but in reality the Welsh weather represents their best chance of avoiding going into next week's second Test at Lord's 1-0 down. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon: \"We're definitely still in it. If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.\"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient.

Conversely, octopuses may display a pale colour after losing a fight or when trying to avoid conflict. It was previously believed that octopuses were largely solitary creatures. Changes to body colour and other behaviour were interpreted as tactics to avoid predators. But Prof Peter Godfrey-Smith said the unique study, based on 53 hours of footage and published on Friday in the journal Current Biology, provided a novel perspective on octopus behaviour.\"[An aggressive] octopus will turn very dark, stand in a way that accentuates its size and it will often seek to stand on a higher spot,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith, who co-authored the report, said.\"Clearly the unusual stance is not a physiological response. It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.\"The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.\"The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the \"Nosferatu pose\", referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape. Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays. The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.\"Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour,\" Prof Godfrey-Smith said. The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus. Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights. The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible. Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses. This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating. Watching these long videos was \"much more exhausting than I expected\", Prof Godfrey Smith said.\"Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.\"If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.\"", "hash": "35426361", "summary": " Biologists studied a group of Sydney octopuses off Australia's east coast and discovered complex social signaling behaviors.

And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (\"there is no alternative\"). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.", "hash": "33847273", "summary": " 1.

Earlier the Police Federation urged her not to base legislation changes on the behaviour of a \"handful of officers\". During her address, Mrs May said suing someone after slipping on their property was \"not the sort of attitude\" officers should exhibit. Her comments come after it emerged recently that one police officer, PC Kelly Jones, had taken legal action after tripping on a kerb at a Norfolk petrol station in August. Mrs May also revealed plans to allow police to take over shoplifting prosecutions where goods taken were worth less than \u00c2\u00a3200.

The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years. By Danny Shaw BBC home affairs correspondent Theresa May's whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by rank-and-file officers - but it's unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the government's programme of cuts and reforms to the service. High on their list of concerns is an idea, currently the subject of negotiation, which would allow chief constables to make police compulsorily redundant. Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they don't like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights there'd be nothing police could do about it. A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer. The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea. The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was \"a particularly appalling crime\".\"We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us,\" she said.\"And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent.\"She added: \"We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.\"The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences. In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated. The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder. A spokesman said: \"Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council.\"But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in. The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases \"if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison\". There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and \"Yorkshire Ripper\" Peter Sutcliffe. The home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last year's conference after she told officers to \"stop pretending\" they were being singled out and would \"have to make their share\" of public spending cuts. Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs May's sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the government's programme of cuts and reforms. Speaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to \"hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers\". The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers. On Tuesday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad.", "hash": "22534665", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "The event on 27 May offers 46- or 95-mile routes snaking through the scenic Trossachs and the Campsie Fells north of Glasgow. The ride will raise money to develop young Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar, who was born in Glasgow in 1958. His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009. For three of the organisers, the sportive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar's achievements. They hope it will safeguard his legacy. Billy Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene. Millar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s. A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France. Smith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe. He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong. He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.\"Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?\" I wondered. Smith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section. Media playback is not supported on this device Lang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: \"In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.\"Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.\"So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.\"He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.\"The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.\"Millar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy. And then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - \"the Caledonian antisyzygy\" on two wheels. Lang put it thus: \"Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.\"Bilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: \"Robert was special.\"He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.\"I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.\"I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour. Media playback is not supported on this device\"When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.\"The sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event. The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.\"He was one of my idols,\" said Smith. \"He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.\"I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.\"And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.\"Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world.\"", "hash": "17592709", "summary": " A cycling event named after Robert Millar, a Scottish cyclist who finished 4th in the 1984 Tour de France and holds the record for the highest Tour de France finish by a British rider, is being organized on May 27, 2023.

Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a3450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents.

{"article": "Chechen Muslim clerics met on 3 April, two days after the paper's revelations, and said the report had insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men.\"Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,\" their resolution said. Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\".\"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.\"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\"Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova.

{"article": "However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins.\"My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog.\"He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors?Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions.\"There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way,\" he explained.\"We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel.\"It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success.\"I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level,\" he said.\"A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people.\"I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there.\"Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent.\"They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones,\" he said.\"It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job.\"That would have been your only break, but time's are changing.\"I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common.\"Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on You Tube", "hash": "31873298", "summary": " The article discusses how actors from the British teen drama \"Skins,\" which aired on a digital channel, have gone on to find success in Hollywood films.

{"article": "Brad Mc Kay crouched to volley in Greg Tansey's deep free-kick early in the match. And Tansey converted a penalty after Massimo Donati had fouled Ross Draper. Accies were upset Ali Crawford was not awarded a second-half spot-kick for a challenge by goalkeeper Ryan Esson but netted late on through Danny Redmond. The gap between Caley Thistle and Motherwell also stands at four points, with Well behind Hamilton on goal difference after losing to Ross County. Media playback is not supported on this device The first-half performance was exactly what Inverness manager Richie Foran has been searching for and came with their backs planted firmly against the wall. They were terrific. Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time. Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above. Tansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found Mc Kay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect. Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure. In truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break. Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive. And, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over. Martin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham. And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down. Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side. Having offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian Mac Kinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm. Dougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence. Redmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.

We will continue this work on this.\"Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem. He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF. The 323-page report said that \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread\" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant. The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were \"sabotaged\" by \"widespread inaction\" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans. Media playback is not supported on this device Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was \"worse than we thought\", adding that \"it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system\". Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition \"until they put their house in order\", adding: \"If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.\"He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that \"athletics has probably got some other nations to root out\". He added that while \"there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics\", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world. During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: \"I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.\"On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of \"darker days to come\". He said: \"This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia.

{"article": "Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest Whats App Linked In Copy this link The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty, a US-based environmental lobby group. Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder, Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek, of turning a blind eye to these practices. Both companies reject the allegations. Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash-and-burn practices by small-scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia. Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra, South Sumatra, and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. Singapore-based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99% of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry, it says it accounts for less than 1% of the global market. Mighty's report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires. It also says Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies\" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources. But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning, so it's a 'no burn-no peat-no deforestation' compliance policy\". The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday, having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so. Mr Verghese said he believed the firm's current suppliers all met Olam's strict requirements, but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete. He added that producers who do not comply with the company's sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain. Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam, Mighty's allegations could link Singapore's state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven. Temasek's investment in Olam means that \"the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze,\" the report says. Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they \"fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\"The fund told the BBC: \"Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address.\"As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.\"It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record. It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible. Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas. The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam \"bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations,\" bringing the same practices to Africa \"that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia\". In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent.\"We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\" it said.\"Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.\"", "hash": "38285834", "summary": " 1.

However, Mighty claimed that Olam created a \"secretive market for rogue palm oil companies,\" allowing the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources.\n3. Olam's CEO, Sunny Verghese, stated that the firm had a \"very vigorous sourcing policy\" and insisted on zero tolerance for burning, deforestation, and peat. He added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete.\n4. Temasek, the majority stakeholder in Olam, dismissed the allegations, stating that they fully support no-burn policies for land clearance and urged oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.\n5. The palm oil industry has a troubled track record, with accusations of unfair and illegal labor practices, deforestation, and burning of plantations. Green groups and palm oil executives often have conflicting views on the issue.\n6. The report also raised concerns about Olam's activities in Gabon, where it was accused of bulldozing rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations. In response, Olam stated that it agreed with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, as long as it was responsibly and transparently done.\n7. Olam's plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain."}

While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as \"dark, ugly little trolls\" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as \"a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile\". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the \"hernia on the end of England\", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it \"smelled of boiled washing\". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a \"dyke on a bike\".

{"article": "At the start of each month Elena, a 40-year-old Muscovite, spreads all the family cash on the table and starts dividing it into small piles.\"When I do this I shake, I feel nauseous,\" she says.\"This goes to one bank, that to another, then the third one\u2026 There's one more bank, but we don't have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food. I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.\"Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks. After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job. Millions of those in debt live like Elena. According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages. By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months. The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks. For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones. It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.\"We were a bit stupid,\" Elena says. \"They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.\"During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about. Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles. Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because \"the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals\". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says. Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October. Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead. Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution. A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: \"I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!\"Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and \"this year it's probably going to be around 16%\". He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow. Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents. His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. \"How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.\"Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance. And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling.\"There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?\" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma.\"Isn't there a law against this?\" asks his father, equally helplessly. \"How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?\"After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.", "hash": "33717488", "summary": " Elena, a 40-year-old Muscovite, and her husband owe over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to four banks, leaving them with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167) each month.

A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS. It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. These included:The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them.

{"article": "It works by looking for a combination of \"markers\" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease. Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics. It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said. The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients. But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.\"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.\"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\"He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment. It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained. Potentially, it could be a \"cheap and easy pre-screen\" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.\"The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.\"If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.\"Dr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital.\"While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising.\"When used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help.\"", "hash": "21712349", "summary": " 1.

The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside.

{"article": "It's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger. Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to\u00a0Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.", "hash": "b71b7737562c6aa7c3ceefcbb2073a35c9854e54", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story\u00a0is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019 The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve Mc Queen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve Mc Queen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting.

{"article": "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U. S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U. S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U. S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U. S Army.", "hash": "e82fd60b8e06755184e0bd8add6967600b6788f1", "summary": " 1.

Shocking allegations of the circumstances surrounding the three-year-old's 2013 death were revealed on Wednesday as family friend who was charged with the toddlers manslaughter was granted bail. The bail hearing revealed that Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0suffered blows to her stomach causing severe bowel damage- ultimately leading to her death. The bail hearing revealed Kyesha-Lee succumbed to massive bowel injuries after being struck days before her death Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin \u00a0was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail.

{"article": "We are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo, be it trying to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or 'touch' the top of a pyramid. One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.'

A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top?

{"article": "Haul: The cherry picker collecting drugs from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool The amount of drugs being thrown over the fence into one prison is so high that warders have been forced to deploy a cherry picker to remove them. Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'.

{"article": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Rescuers in Nepal have pulled a man from the wreckage of a building where he was stuck for a staggering 82 hours after the devastating earthquake that hit the country Saturday. His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K. C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Moni Basu, Manesh Shrestha, Ivan Watson, Tim Hume and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.", "hash": "65eab2505a62dab04413d9ee6a2d95f3a0f655a2", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "The number plate that got Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear colleagues harangued out of Argentina was a direct reference to the Falklands War, a judge has ruled. While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson\u2019s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson\u2019s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May\u2019s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina\u2019s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson\u2019s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson\u2019s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes.

{"article": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U. S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "hash": "8610ead0a43054be202a1fc756620415a6d572fe", "summary": " A New York judge allowed the service of divorce papers to be delivered to a husband through Facebook, marking a new development in the evolving law of \"service of process.\" Service of process refers to the legal requirement of notifying a person being sued about the lawsuit.

{"article": "Royal Bank of Scotland has racked up \u00a350billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers and warned last night that it faces another \u2018tough year\u2019. The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross Mc Ewan said: \u2018This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.\u2019 The latest news wiped more than \u00a3700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin \u2013 nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting \u2013 was even knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the Tax Payers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. \u2018It\u2019s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.\u2019", "hash": "2d4ca8fe13f3481241a85bd750cdb7159edd097a", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "Sleepy kid: Brock Guzman, 8, was last seen inside his parents silver 2001 Toyota Corolla. Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a. m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a. m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn Mc Cormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' Mc Cormick said.

{"article": "A bruising training session involving 50 scrums is how Tom Wood\u2019s Northampton prepared for Saturday\u2019s top-of-the-table meeting with Saracens. The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints\u2019 opponents have \u2018smelt blood\u2019, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf \u2018I don\u2019t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Some people think you\u2019re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It\u2019s a couple of per cent across the board. \u2018You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It\u2019s a combination of things and it\u2019s difficult to manage. \u2018Now there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel and we\u2019re not far off full strength. It\u2019s the home straight.\u2019 Saturday\u2019s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin\u2019s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton\u2019s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. \u2018We\u2019ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. \u2018When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We\u2019ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don\u2019t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes \u2018We\u2019ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.\u2019 But Saints\u2019 season is still very much alive.

Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,\u2019 said Monye. \u2018It\u2019s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I\u2019ve been here since I finished school and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve known.

{"article": "A schoolboy with a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear. James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too.

As 14million working households \u2013 more than nine in ten \u2013 are given an average boost of \u00a3200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money \u2013 because they \u2018know best\u2019 how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018crackpot Government schemes\u2019. \u2018There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers\u2019 money,\u2019 he will say. \u2018And we believe it\u2019s people \u2013 not politicians \u2013 who know best how to spend their own money.

Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through Pay Pal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe. com. Thats whats up. Bowe And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @Jake Lee Yes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004\u00a0he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune.

The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t.

When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like.

Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women around four months\u2019 extra life. The drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by European regulators. Patients will have access via the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until it is considered for routine NHS use. It has been available in England via the CDF since last March pending licensing. Scroll down for video Drug: Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women about four months\u2019 extra life Each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from Avastin, costing \u00a33,370 for a month\u2019s treatment. The drug\u2019s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Cervical cancer:\u00a0Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab and widely used in patients with bowel cancer, is the first new treatment since the chemotherapy drug topotecan was approved in 2006. Dr Mary Mc Cormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said \u2018Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \u2018For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. \u2018For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.\u2019 Robert Music, chief executive of Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said \u2018This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. \u2018Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.\u2019 Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) \u2013 a key driver for tumour growth.

Fighters from 100 nations \u2013 more than half the countries in the world \u2013 have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in \u2018a veritable \u201cinternational finishing school\u201d for extremists\u2019 as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March \u2013 three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters \u2018is higher than it has ever been historically\u2019. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has \u2018risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,\u2019 the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the \u2018watch list\u2019 in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it\u2019s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the \u2018high number\u2019of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks \u2018pose an immediate and long-term threat\u2019 and \u2018an urgent global security problem\u2019 that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack \u2018is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues\u2019. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is \u2018generating public panic\u2019 and stressed that the response needs to \u2018be measured, effective and proportionate.\u2019 It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.", "hash": "8ececf760ca96748a4f75d7fa7c1e13092738fbf", "summary": " 1.

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too.

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don't need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester.\" The judge told him not to swear. \"I don't give a f--- what you want,\" Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. \"Yes, Ron was gay. But people need to get over it,\" Smith said. \"That's between him and the Lord, him and his savior.\"", "hash": "5ec241bce317fef97331e1d385b67dab05f5b1dc", "summary": " 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III appeared in court on Thursday for a first-degree murder charge in connection to the shooting death of Ron Lane at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina.

She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism.

{"article": "(CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" and defines as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus.\" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if \"necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,\" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.

Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri criticized the move, describing it as dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The organization also stated that Kansas now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the US.

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998.

{"article": "Most people give up chocolate for Lent but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own. Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.'

Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they\u2019ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature.

{"article": "The country\u2019s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year. The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019", "hash": "d630035ba94ce748c4870e420ea807bf3701414e", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "The ethnic minority population in Britain will more than double by the middle of this century, meaning one in four Britons will be from black or minority groups by 2051, research shows. The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place. 'Crowding and congestion will have entirely negative effects, increasing pressure on schools, hospitals and particularly housing.'", "hash": "eb78a53cb8d33151880618d65cfebcefd103da34", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.", "hash": "a977c81aebc46b867132c2b6d594962d67522de0", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of One Taste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which\u00a0aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'.\u00a0OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world.\u00a0There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting.\u00a0In the classes, which cost \u00a3195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company One Taste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company Turn ON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the \u00a3195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently\u00a02,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain Director of US company One Taste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been \"on the menu\" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone.

'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge.

'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy.

For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The victory was the first of Dick Advocaat's reign and moved Sunderland up to 15th. Defoe has compared the feeling of scoring the winner against Newcastle to scoring at the World Cup Defoe added: 'The manager said to use beforehand that we were lucky to be playing in a game like this. 'There are so many young kids who wish they could play in a game like this. To be blessed enough and to score the winner is amazing. 'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'.

Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man living near his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent, the Old Bailey heard. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole \u00a3185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. \u2018The benefit was \u00a3185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same\u2019, said prosecutor David Hughes. \u2018The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.\u2019 Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. \u2018If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.\u2019 Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today\u2019s hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: \u2018It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.\u2019 The court also heard statements from two of Mason\u2019s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: \u2018I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.\u2019 Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting  in Afghanistan Elaine May, the current manager of the Nat West Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had \u2018an ongoing impact within the community\u2019 and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: \u2018You stole roughly \u00a3185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. \u2018Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for Nat West since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. \u2018Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. \u2018You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. \u2018Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. \u2018I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. \u2018In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.\u2019 Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud.

Still, at least they returned a club record profit of \u00a318.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this \u2013 grey, with little sign of light.

In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video In the beautiful new pictures by\u00a0Gis\u00e8le Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gis\u00e8le Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs Photographs by Gis\u00e8le Freund Texts by G\u00e9rard de Cortanze, Gis\u00e8le Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress \u2026 not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about \u2026 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table Frida stands in the grounds of her gardens, her pose striking against the flora and fauna Frida stands in her garden a long shawl drapped elegantly around her shoulders", "hash": "c2743d6a92cda5d790f1e6c4417c0c4f6728e5d5", "summary": " A new book, Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs, features previously unseen images of Frida Kahlo taken by French photographer Gis\u00e8le Freund between 1950 and 1954.

A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David Mc Lachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr Mc Lachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr Mc Lachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr Mc Lachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr Mc Lachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying.

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress.

{"article": "(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

The TSA is still trying to identify the passenger involved in the February incident and has not received any similar reports at the Denver airport. Previous incidents of airport workers stealing from luggage have been exposed through hidden cameras."}
{"article": "Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped.

'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U. S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U. S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U. S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.", "hash": "425a5e56cf27b2edbd322033d6669c71b48c1633", "summary": "  Six Minnesota men, including Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, Adnan Abdihamid Farah, Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, Abdurahman Yasin Daud, Hanad Mustafe Musse, and Guled Ali Omar, have been charged with conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group (ISIS).

{"article": "A midwife has today accepted her mistakes 'contributed' to the deaths of two babies at a scandal-hit maternity unit. Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal. The misconduct hearing, which is expected to last a month, will hear from several witnesses including the two patients who lost their children. The hearing heard that Ms Ratcliffe qualified as a midwife in 1990 and in 1997 she was promoted to a Band 7 Midwife at Furness General Hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where she worked until January 2014.

{"article": "Boston (CNN)Guilty across the board. But will he face death? After deliberating for 11\u00bd hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. \"Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. \"And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. \"Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case,\" Callan said about Clarke.

{"article": "(CNN)A Delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U. S. Virgin Islands. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U. S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U. S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.", "hash": "9eb7dd37e50b863e99b554ed340e7b766c1b6329", "summary": " A Delaware family, including a father and his two teenage sons, fell ill with possible pesticide exposure while on vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands at the Sirenusa resort.

Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack.

'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body.

While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online.

'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.'

'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends.

{"article": "Washington (CNN)This week is the 100th anniversary of what many historians acknowledge as the Armenian genocide -- the Turkish massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U. S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U. S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U. S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U. S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U. S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote.", "hash": "d061579cf4bbbbf4cb5735532e54fb695a1555cb", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "David Cameron today announced plans to give millions of workers three days paid leave a year to do volunteer work. The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as\u00a0heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.' But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (Io D), criticised the announcement, saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through. 'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the Io D thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The Io D would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake.\u00a0He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme.\u00a0'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'", "hash": "fb1117897822bddb6586aa283e4a67d82b507f3a", "summary": " 1.

Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink \u00a311.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins. com CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 \u00a319.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent.

Developed by a U. S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure.

EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation.

Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells.

But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft. The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to\u00a0People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to\u00a0manoeuvre However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite. Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world.

In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don\u2019t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I\u2019m not fighting against them. I\u2019m fighting against the way they are going about it.' It is not clear what the demonstrators were rallying against. They did not answer reporters' questions about what their cause was. Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition - \u00a0and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William Mc Kinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country.

{"article": "A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U. S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan Mc Guigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan Mc Guigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' Mc Guigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U. S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on Mc Guigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum", "hash": "7447c4b76699b362889acda7ca184f1099401fc9", "summary": " 78-year-old Connecticut man Robert Gentile was arrested and charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent on Friday, but his lawyer, Ryan McGuigan, claimed the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile into talking about the $500 million art heist from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum that occurred 25 years ago.

{"article": "Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered. Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P. S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "hash": "71530c72c132ba3c2ebc4376ec1b2cda77ef75cd", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "There are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud. The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer\u00a0Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05\u00b0C to 0.12\u00b0C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000\u00b0C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings\u00a0suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.", "hash": "d75a950d495bad51ac7c8657871328b8732f44c7", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "(CNN)Kayahan, one of Turkey's best-loved singers and songwriters, died of cancer Friday at the age of 66. He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a  frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.", "hash": "996940764a066a9c16f622c873ad041ac5521fa3", "summary": " Turkish singer and songwriter Kayahan, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, passed away at the age of 66 due to cancer on March 4, five days after his birthday.

Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore.

Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away.

{"article": "A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial, sobbing as she accepted the agreement in court. One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, \u2018Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?\u2019 Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection\u00a0to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having\u00a0sex with three boys Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal.", "hash": "34c643a2b86b20a0319d57a17e603752afadb410", "summary": " A former Utah high school teacher, Brianne Altice, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students on March 27, 2019.

{"article": "When Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago, she thought she had found the perfect place to call home. But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'", "hash": "9056f691c18f7f0fd4658011b5c5376905c761ad", "summary": " 28-year-old Emma Jackson moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull last year, but her dream home turned into a nightmare due to an aggressive neighbor, Mark Ray, who had a habit of watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day.

{"article": "Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United at Elland Road after the Welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets. Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The \"bad old days\" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of \"fans\" have thankfully been left far behind us now.

{"article": "(CNN)An unmanned Russian spacecraft originally bound for the International Space Station will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere after flight controllers lost contact with it, American astronaut Scott Kelly said Wednesday. The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh Space X commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U. S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said.

But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.", "hash": "d5a6a1859a3bb1fa76d95b1fa56114816299448e", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "Three men accused of being agents of the Syrian government have been executed in a shocking new video, Islamic State has claimed. The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be\u00a0Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive and a large area is now divided between Kurdish and IS control.

{"article": "The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest.

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals. But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session - and warned about his behaviour. Ronnie O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Olivier Marteel in his second round match against Matthew Stevens O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed.

{"article": "This is the moment a paedophile was caught by police after grooming a girl he believed to be 14 on the internet. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court\u00a0after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it.

The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 Ms Sturgeon has\u00a0 vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.'

However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills.

The most popular policy according to the poll was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, followed by giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits and transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood.\n4. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 received a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU.\n5. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies and the need for more power for Scotland.\n6. The poll also showed that Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit but also favor the Government's welfare cap, as well as support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p."}

Victory over fourth-placed Valencia will take Enrique's men at least temporarily five points clear at the top of the table with title rivals Real Madrid not kicking off against Malaga until evening. But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris.

'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.'

Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality.

Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press.

{"article": "They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there\u2019s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their i Pad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (\u00a316), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America \u2013 including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed. It's unclear what the cost of these hockey pucks was, but the average American high schooler could spend over $300 just asking his or her date to the yearly dance In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year \u2014 I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B. Alexander High School in Laredo, Texas, senior student Isaac Garza asked his best friend, Kristelle, to prom in dramatic pre-planned chase scene with the school . Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You.

As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities. This year, Canadians plan to spend $508 overall on prom of which $151 will be on promposal, compared to $919 overall for U. S. families. Dads plan to outspend moms by 63%, $1160vs. $710.

{"article": "Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat Mac Arthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that.

{"article": "Our young Earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet Mercury, says a new paper. The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth\u2019s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet\u2019s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth\u2019s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth\u2019s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth\u2019s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the \u2018dynamo\u2019 of molten iron in Earth\u2019s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. \u2018We think that that is quite conceivable,\u2019 said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. \u2018It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.\u2019 In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought.. For example, if true, it would raise further questions about \u2018how Earth ended up in its present oxidised state, which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years.\u2019", "hash": "ed8674cc15b29a87d8df8de1efee353d71122272", "summary": " A new study published in the journal Nature suggests that the young Earth collided with a Mercury-like body around 4.5 billion years ago, providing an explanation for the planet's hot core and magnetic field, as well as the higher ratio of certain rare-earth elements in Earth's mantle compared to meteorites.

{"article": "(CNN)Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U. S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U. S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U. S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was Jet Blue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U. S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U. S. seats. (Jet Blue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many Jet Blue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U. S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U. S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U. S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U. S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by Jet Blue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.", "hash": "abd69dcc1c91c304762d59d93b87bdd6af794b6c", "summary": " 1.

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an Uber X driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at e Bay, Pay Pal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an Uber X driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in.

{"article": "A nervous Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta on Friday to watch her beau Tiger Woods in his quest for a fifth Masters title - and fifth green jacket. And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as\u00a0Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me. And with 36 holes here to go, anything can happen.'", "hash": "37c6e6095b2283af35145f46f1c71068699ad7fb", "summary": " 14-time major golf champion Tiger Woods played in the second round of the Masters Tournament on Friday, with his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watching from the sidelines.

{"article": "A 20-year-old British tourist has claimed she was molested by a taxi driver in Jaipur, who has now been arrested (pictured posed by model) A taxi driver in India has been arrested after being accused of molesting a British tourist. The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.", "hash": "eafe2c8df2fb9221daf4e3868cfc1d7b27c1e02c", "summary": " 1.

However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.", "hash": "50f3f06b88fef68e3219e358c254e2e6860f9196", "summary": " 1.

The humanoid, known as Ham, has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in Hong Kong this week. The head, designed by American robotics designer David Hanson, is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios. Scroll down for video Incredibly lifelike: Known as Ham, this humanoid is made using\u00a0specialised software and can recognise and respond to facial expressions Ham is currently on exhibit at the Global Sources spring electronics show at Asia World Expo - the largest event of its kind in the world, with more than 4,000 booths displaying the latest gadgets. The head is created with malleable material called Frubber\u00a0using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre). Using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way. According to Hanson Robotics's website, the humanoids can actually see your face, make eye contact with you, and understand speech to 'engage you in witty dialogue'. Such reactions are a major feat of engineering, according to chief designer David Hanson, the founder and and president of Hanson Robotics. Reactive: The robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes State-of-the-art:\u00a0The head is created with malleable material using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre) It is not the first human-looking robot that his firm has created either. An earlier version of Ham drew headlines as it was sculpted to look like Albert Einstein, complete with a bushy moustache and a shock of white hair. The Einstein humanoid made facial expressions by using multiple motors - which whir\u00a0into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes. Mr Hanson sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts, from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence. To advance to the next step of producing robots for everyday applications in entertainment, health care and education, he decided to move to Hong Kong with his family - his wife Amanda and their son Zeno. The city has a booming robotics community with a high amount of expertise and design infrastructure and new technology can be developed at a lower cost than in the US.

The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: \u2018True compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance.\u2019 He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning \u00a387 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work.

And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net \u2013 not a web from which no-one could escape. \u2018So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. \u2018It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don\u2019t you dare lecture us on poverty. \u2018And know this \u2013 the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.\u2019 Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. \u2018For many second earners, work didn\u2019t pay because the cost of childcare was so high.

{"article": "Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s absence to \u2018get to the bottom of the allegations\u2019.

After Beck was jailed, many politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby.\n8. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders defended her decision not to prosecute Janner and denied any conflict of interest regarding her senior legal adviser's connection to Janner's QC son."}
{"article": "Warrington put a dampener on Kevin Sinfield's 500th appearance for Leeds as they completed a notable double over the Super League leaders in emphatic fashion at Headingley. Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward\u00a0Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.", "hash": "0ccc7d7223489e89d2b91271d2a0b1c4ac9c20e2", "summary": " In front of a crowd of 17,430 at Headingley, Warrington Wolves defeated Leeds Rhinos 29-10, handing Kevin Sinfield, who was making his 500th appearance for the Rhinos, a losing debut and a repeat of his first loss with the team against Sheffield Eagles in 1997.

Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in Kwa Zulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's\u00a0Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission.\u00a0We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria. Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane said there were no signs of forced entry into the room - and the number of intruders was 'unclear'. 'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.'

It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents.

{"article": "The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs\u2019 committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: \u2018I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. \u2018It\u2019s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.\u2019", "hash": "113e651a0a484955a0596662185587e648e5ee55", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "Blackburn should brace themselves for interest in their players from top-flight clubs following their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, manager Gary Bowyer has said. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!'

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience.

{"article": "Tom Ballard plans to climb K2, 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak A climber has set his sights on the summit of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - 20 years after his mother died attempting the same feat. Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen.

When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb.

Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend\u00a0Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600.

Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud Allen also splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a \u00a3700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where \u00a333,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including \u00a31,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back \u00a3491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back \u00a310,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. \u2018Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,\u2019 prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. \u2018The money would have been criminal proceeds.\u2019 During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures.

{"article": "Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life.

{"article": "Famed for phenomenal cuisine, majestic rural landscapes and vibrant cities, Vietnam offers an undisputed sensory overload. But there's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter. Lee Thompson's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award-winning photojournalist covering the civil war in Libya, the revolution in Egypt, the tsunami in Japan and other extensive travels before he co-founded The Flash Pack, a small group flashpacking tour company. But even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast Asia can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle, and on one of his company's\u00a0Vietnam & Cambodia\u00a0tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest. There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter\u00a0in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

{"article": "Jason Cotterill, 42, sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex partner to her children and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse A jilted lover who sent explicit revenge porn images of his ex-partner to her daughter and set up 67 Facebook profiles to bombard her with abuse has been jailed. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\u00a0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He\u00a0recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found\u00a0guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting\u00a0his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a\u00a0three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening\u00a0manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her,\u00a0you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to\u00a0the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get\u00a0to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of\u00a0those photos.'", "hash": "f2fc9b0cdf763a3762e3580214ffbdd9c2c15895", "summary": " 42-year-old Jason Cotterill was sentenced to 12 weeks in jail and banned indefinitely from contacting his ex-partner after he sent explicit revenge porn images to her children and set up 67 Facebook profiles to harass and abuse her.

Despite this, Cotterill continued to send her abusive messages and threats, even going so far as to email her a link to an online sex video she was in and threaten to post it on her Facebook page. The victim, who had previously worked as a sex worker and had made sex tapes in the past, was deeply distressed by the harassment and suffered from depression and panic attacks. The court heard that Cotterill, who had two previous convictions for harassment, recognized his need for help and regretted his actions. However, District Judge David Robinson noted the aggravating features of the case, including Cotterill's use of multiple Facebook profiles and his attempts to involve others in the harassment."}
{"article": "Lewis Hamilton has conceded to feeling more powerful now than at any stage in his F1 career. It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain\u00a0Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former Mc Laren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said. 'Now I have to see if I can improve, and I want to improve when I get to Barcelona.'", "hash": "e1532b5d4b83d557c234758ba657ac9458b91d0b", "summary": " 1.

{"article": "(CNN)Sofia Vergara's ex-fiance is speaking out about their dispute over frozen embryos created while they dated. In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday,  Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress. \"I wanted to keep this private, but recently the story broke to the world,\" Loeb wrote. \"It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is Sofia Vergara, who stars in the ABC series \"Modern Family\" -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life, religion and parenthood.\" Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later, at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate. After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term, they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm. \"When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?,\" he said. \"... A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects?\" Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. He filed it in August in Santa Monica, California, where they apparently lived while they dated. \"We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties' consent. The form did not specify -- as California law requires -- what would happen if we separated,\" he said. \" I am asking to have it voided.\" Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past. Loeb has said he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. He said he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello.", "hash": "30d6fa71c77ac790d814357addb45a31c27ee2a7", "summary": " In an op-ed published in The New York Times, Sofia Vergara's ex-fiance, Nick Loeb, discussed their ongoing dispute over two frozen embryos they created while dating.

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education.

{"article": "Arsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections.

{"article": "New Delhi, India (CNN)As the earth shook in Nepal, tremors were felt over the border in India as well. It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work.
