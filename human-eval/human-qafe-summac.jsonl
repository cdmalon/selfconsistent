The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he played with a Hillsborough Justice Campaign banner draped on his bagpipes in April 2015. He was cleared of the two other counts by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court. Sgt Chris Gaynor told the court during the two day trial that Carpenter, from Woolton, gave the impression he was collecting cash for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice. But he said he had made it clear he was not use it to collect funds for the charity. Carpenter told the court the banner was a tribute to the victims, not an attempt to deceive anyone. He also told the court he was a familiar face on match days at Anfield and known as a busker to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. He will be sentenced in January."}

'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'.

Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\""}

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed Vf L Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left. The German champions, who host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League quarter-final second leg after Wednesday's 3-1 loss, were without half a dozen starters, including Philipp Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Thomas Muller celebrates after\u00a0Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck scored a stoppage time own goal But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in top form, spectacularly denying Anthony Modeste at point blank range after a defensive blunder by Brazilian Dante. Rode then made the most of Bayern's second chance of the game, curling his shot from the edge of the box past keeper Oliver Baumann. Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half. They did get a second goal when Thomas Mueller charged into the box and cut the ball back to the unfortunate Hoffenheim captain Beck who slipped the ball into his own net. Bayern's Sebastian Rode (eft) scores the opening goal from close range against Hoffenheim on Saturday Bayern Munich's players surround Sebastian Rode after he opened the scoring for the Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen crushed relegation-threatened visitors Hanover 96 4-0 to jump into third spot on goal difference after Borussia Moenchengladbach, also on 54 points, drew 0-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday. Borussia Dortmund eased past visiting Paderborn 3-0, in their first game since the announcement that coach Juergen Klopp would leave at the end of the season, to keep their hopes of a Europa League place alive. Last season's Bundesliga runners-up Dortmund climbed to 36 points, in eighth, three off sixth-placed Augsburg.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live\u2019s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin\u2019s Hotel Carlina after the England game.

Pollsters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government. A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented, while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately. Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1,000 adults between 19 and 25 March. Click here to see the full results. Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals, which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits. Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6.8Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7.2Increase minimum wage to \u00a37.85 8.2The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions, which scored 7.3 out of 10 on the scale. Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits, with a score of 7.1. Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum. When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10, where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly, each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores. Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10, a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits (7.1), full control of income tax (6.8) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs (6.5). Interestingly, analysis shows that, for each of these issues, support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted 'Yes' in last year's referendum. Read Mark's analysis of the poll. The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6.8. Still popular, but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6.5, was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy. The results of the poll suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence. Voters gave the policy statement \"hold another referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years\" a score of 5.6 out of 10. Cap amount paid in welfare to a household 6.3Limit numbers coming to live in UK 6.3Give Holyrood full control of welfare 7.1The policy statement \"hold a referendum to ask people whether they wish to stay in or leave the European Union\" was slightly more popular, with a score of 6.1 out of 10. The idea of stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years scored 6.8. The policy of putting a limit on the number of people coming to live in the UK was less popular, with a score of 6.3. As ever, how much the next government should spend and how much it should tax is proving to be one of the central issues of the UK general election campaign. And there seems to be little doubt as to where the majority of Scots stand on this issue, at least if the evidence of BBC Scotland's issues poll is to be believed. The poll strongly suggests that:Read Professor Curtice's analysis of the poll Increasing the amount spent on the armed forces was scored 6.2. However, renewing and upgrading the Trident nuclear deterrent, came joint last in the poll of priorities, with a score of 4.0.

After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same.

Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.

Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour.

He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10 to various policy statements, each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores.  Support was higher among groups who are more likely to have voted 'Yes' in last year's referendum.  The poll also suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence.  The most popular policy statements were giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and pensions, and full control of welfare benefits.  The least popular policy statements were renewing and upgrading the Trident nuclear deterrent, and stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years.", "article": "However, the nation seems divided over whether there should be another referendum on independence in the near future. Pollsters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government. A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented, while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately. Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1,000 adults between 19 and 25 March.

Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals, which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits. Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6.8Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7.2Increase minimum wage to \u00a37.85 8.2The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions, which scored 7.3 out of 10 on the scale. Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits, with a score of 7.1. Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum. When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10, where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly, each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores. Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10, a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits (7.1), full control of income tax (6.8) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs (6.5). Interestingly, analysis shows that, for each of these issues, support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted 'Yes' in last year's referendum. Read Mark's analysis of the poll. The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6.8. Still popular, but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6.5, was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy. The results of the poll suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence. Voters gave the policy statement \"hold another referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years\" a score of 5.6 out of 10. Cap amount paid in welfare to a household 6.3Limit numbers coming to live in UK 6.3Give Holyrood full control of welfare 7.1The policy statement \"hold a referendum to ask people whether they wish to stay in or leave the European Union\" was slightly more popular, with a score of 6.1 out of 10. The idea of stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years scored 6.8. The policy of putting a limit on the number of people coming to live in the UK was less popular, with a score of 6.3. As ever, how much the next government should spend and how much it should tax is proving to be one of the central issues of the UK general election campaign. And there seems to be little doubt as to where the majority of Scots stand on this issue, at least if the evidence of BBC Scotland's issues poll is to be believed. The poll strongly suggests that:Read Professor Curtice's analysis of the poll Increasing the amount spent on the armed forces was scored 6.2. However, renewing and upgrading the Trident nuclear deterrent, came joint last in the poll of priorities, with a score of 4.0. The poll also indicated some support for bringing the railways back into public ownership - this scored 6.5 out of 10.\"Ensuring authorities cannot access personal data unless an individual is suspected of taking part in an illegal activity\" was among the most popular policy statements tested, with a score of 7.6.

S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan Mc Guigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan Mc Guigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' Mc Guigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U. S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on Mc Guigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum"}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today."}

In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice. But he said he had made it clear he was not use it to collect funds for the charity. Carpenter told the court the banner was a tribute to the victims, not an attempt to deceive anyone. He also told the court he was a familiar face on match days at Anfield and known as a busker to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. He will be sentenced in January."}

League One clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat \u2014 Rodwell and former Manchester United director Maurice Watkins, now chairman of Barnsley. Tony Fernandes, owner of QPR, wants to avoid fines of up to \u00a350million for Financial Fair Play breaches Maurice Watkins is a sports lawyer whose firm represents QPR over their considerable FFP troubles QPR are 19th in the Premier League, four points away from escaping the relegation zone Watkins is a sports lawyer and his firm Brabners are representing QPR over their considerable FFP troubles.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live\u2019s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin\u2019s Hotel Carlina after the England game.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash."}

On Monday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would look at whether a case was dropped by Wiltshire Police when a person involved made claims against Sir Edward. Forde was later convicted of controlling prostitutes after a successful prosecution by the same force. She was jailed for six years after a trial that included allegations that she had supplied children as young as 13 to her clients. Fourteen years later Forde was prosecuted and jailed again for inciting prostitution. Richard Griffiths, Forde's solicitor in 1992, has now spoken on her behalf to the Salisbury Journal. He told the newspaper: \"My former client wishes me to make it very clear that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued.\"For the avoidance of any doubt, Myra Forde wishes me to make it clear that she had no involvement with Ted Heath of any kind and has no knowledge of any misconduct on his part.\"He also said that, at the time of that case, the prosecution \"took what, at the time, seemed a sensible decision that they could not prove their case and offered no evidence\". Historical child abuse: Key investigations A spokesman for the UK's ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard, said that although the allegations about Sir Edward fell within its terms of reference, it had not received any direct allegations. Sir Edward, who was Conservative prime minister from 1970 to 1974, died aged 89 in 2005  at his home in Salisbury. Wiltshire Police has declined to comment on the claims that it did not follow up accusations against him during his lifetime, but has appealed for information regarding allegations against Sir Edward. Meanwhile, Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012, with police confirming that at least one of those allegations was being investigated. Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims, saying there is not a shred of evidence to link him to abuse. The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it \"wholeheartedly\" believed the investigation would clear Sir Edward's name."}

Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too.

The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said.

If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.\"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\"England batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow. We are going to have to work hard to win.\""}

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don't need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester.\" The judge told him not to swear. \"I don't give a f--- what you want,\" Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. \"Yes, Ron was gay. But people need to get over it,\" Smith said. \"That's between him and the Lord, him and his savior.\""}

Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too.

The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\"It could be that Australia is odd.

The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers. It found \"no support\" for the \"reticent female\" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money. For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females. When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found. The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype. When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications. The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\"It could be that Australia is odd.

The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place. 'Crowding and congestion will have entirely negative effects, increasing pressure on schools, hospitals and particularly housing.'"}

His attorney, Ryan Mc Guigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan Mc Guigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' Mc Guigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U. S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on Mc Guigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum"}

Forde was later convicted of controlling prostitutes after a successful prosecution by the same force.

Historical child abuse: Key investigations A spokesman for the UK's ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard, said that although the allegations about Sir Edward fell within its terms of reference, it had not received any direct allegations. Sir Edward, who was Conservative prime minister from 1970 to 1974, died aged 89 in 2005  at his home in Salisbury. Wiltshire Police has declined to comment on the claims that it did not follow up accusations against him during his lifetime, but has appealed for information regarding allegations against Sir Edward. Meanwhile, Labour MP Tom Watson said he had referred two allegations of child sexual abuse by Sir Edward to the police since 2012, with police confirming that at least one of those allegations was being investigated. Friends of Sir Edward have dismissed the claims, saying there is not a shred of evidence to link him to abuse. The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it \"wholeheartedly\" believed the investigation would clear Sir Edward's name."}

Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court."}

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash."}

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998. A survey released last year by Direct Health Solutions found Australian employees took on average of 10 sick days per year. It estimated that Australia experiences an annual cost of $33 billion in lost productivity from sick days."}

Sebastian Rode scored in the 38th minute and Hoffenheim's Andreas Beck added an own goal in stoppage time as Bayern, with youngsters Mitchell Weiser and Gianluca Gaudino in the lineup, opened a 13-point lead over second-placed VfL Wolfsburg, in action against Schalke 04 on Sunday, with five matches left.

Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half.

James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too. 'Luckily she wasn't.'"}

In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them.\"Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication,\" the briefing said.\"These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish],\" the briefing adds. TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a \"worst case scenario\" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish. The \u00c2\u00a31.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay. UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published. Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was \"very supportive\" of the scheme. But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the \"very, very near future.\"NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was \"very surprised and disappointed by\". Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: \"We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology.\"This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do.\""}

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday to their cross-city rivals at Old Trafford"}

Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend\u00a0Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600. Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud Allen also splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a \u00a3700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where \u00a333,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including \u00a31,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back \u00a3491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back \u00a310,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. \u2018Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,\u2019 prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. \u2018The money would have been criminal proceeds.\u2019 During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600 Mr Evans told the jury: \u2018Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.\u2019 Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made. The judge will consider on Thursday whether to impose on Allen a strict financial reporting order which would force him to present the authorities with regular documents showing his use of money."}

Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan Mc Guigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' Mc Guigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U. S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on Mc Guigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum"}

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge.

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte.

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report."}

Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today."}

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies"}

Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10, a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits (7.1), full control of income tax (6.8) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs (6.5).

It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change. Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\""}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today."}

Villagers from Shoma Ying said that his younger brother had been on the same junction last August, when a collision with a lorry killed him instantly, according to the People's Daily Online. Tragic: The man, only named as Mr Zhang, was thrown off his motorbike when he was hit by a car. He later died in hospital from his injuries Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike. Shu Rongli, a police officer from the Dezhou City Public Security Bureau, said that the newly constructed road was not open yet and did not even have road signs. Aftermath: The trailer of the motorbike was found 30 metres away from the main vehicle Poignant: Vegetables sold by Mr Zhang at the local market were found in the trailer after the crash He added that those using it were doing so illegally. The driver in the silver car, who was using a fake registration plate, is under investigation by the police. Shu said that those involved in the accident lacked road safety knowledge, and he reminded motorists to be careful at junctions.

Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers.

It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain\u00a0Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said. 'Now I have to see if I can improve, and I want to improve when I get to Barcelona.'"}

Just one kilogram of shark fin can fetch up to \u00a3180 through wholesale markets.

They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' Mc Guigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U. S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on Mc Guigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum"}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today."}

He later died in hospital from his injuries Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic. Mr Zhang, who was unmarried, sold vegetables at the local market and was believed to use the stretch of road on a daily basis. Leftover vegetables were found in the trailer after the accident, which was found 30 metres away from the crushed motorbike.

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.'

Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too.

The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's."}

Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'"}

'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend\u2019s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.' The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase\u2019s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime. Boase, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving, said: 'My intention is never to drink again.'"}

But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'"}

'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours. The Carnival Spirit remains stuck outside Sydney Heads due to the swell and may not be able to enter the harbour for 48 hours Carnival Cruise Liners in statement said: 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open' In a further statement placed on social media, to those travellers caught out by the drama, they said: 'We are sorry to announce that Carnival Spirit will be unable to sail from Sydney today as the port of Sydney has been closed due to extreme weather and ships are not permitted to enter Sydney Harbour.' 'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney."}

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel Mc Cann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr Mc Cann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\"."}

Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal.

The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy.

Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019"}

Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel Mc Cann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr Mc Cann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\"."}

Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London:Media playback is not supported on this device\"For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week.\"We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself.\"We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club.\"We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs.\"Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London:\"I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline.\"If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable.\"Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year.\""}

But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'"}

'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship\u2019s operation in any way.\u00a0Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.'

'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.'

'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney."}

But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'"}

The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'. 'We are committed to preventing drugs coming into our prison and we are encouraged that, at the same time as our seizures of banned substances have increased, the numbers of prisoners testing positive for them has come down,' said Mr Thompson."}

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music \u2014 that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'"}

Still, at least they returned a club record profit of \u00a318.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this \u2013 grey, with little sign of light.

She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana.

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U. S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U. S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U. S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U. S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U. S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote."}

I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.\"Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences. Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel Mc Cann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr Mc Cann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\"."}

Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don\u2019t think she\u2019s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she\u2019s probably doing that advisably, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019 Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a \u2018shop window mannequin\u2019 and a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess who has been \u2018designed by committee\u2019. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn\u2019t have a \u2018single opinion\u2019 of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate \u2018unambitious and bland\u2019."}

Am I right?If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online:Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.\"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says.\"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\"Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.\"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker.\"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\"The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, i Phone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral. de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\"He was a great communicator.\"Sounds like a seal of approval to me."}

Danny Tickle converted the first try of the night from Owens, who latched onto a cut-out pass on the left flank. Hanbury exploited a massive gap in the Warrington defence to go over and Flynn scored the home side's third try, after Stef Marsh's flick pass out of the back door created the opportunity.

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U. S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U. S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.

S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote."}

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms.

An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in.

Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, i Phone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral. de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\"He was a great communicator.\"Sounds like a seal of approval to me."}

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court\u00a0after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it. Adeli has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK and was also placed on a 10 year sexual offences prevention order"}

Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma is a relatively rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. 'Everyone deserves to be loved. You love selflessly, you love with everything you have and he's done that and I've done that and it's made for an incredible story.

A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn):Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine?BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But they failed to galvanise protests against him."}

A homeless group has criticized the arrangement as \"a new low.\"  Do you have any specific questions or points you would like me to address in my summary?", "article": "Investing Solutions received those benefit payments over the past two years by finding properties for single homeless men. The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities. Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is \"a new low\". Investing Solutions said \"the bulk\" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords. The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord. Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London. Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010. The documents say the charity would help \"the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress\". Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable. In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants. The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property. The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing \"the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation\". But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room. One of the tenants, Nigel Mc Cann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp. He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable. Mr Mc Cann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m. The council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\". Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees. He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\". He also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\". Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants. It also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions. A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\"."}

The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash.

'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend\u2019s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder.

The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase\u2019s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime. Boase, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving, said: 'My intention is never to drink again.'"}

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U. S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U. S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U. S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U. S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U. S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote."}

Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction. It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life. Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: \"It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).\"\"I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.\"Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English.

I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.\"He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.\"He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'. And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\"There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.\"It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,\" added Tally Evans.\"There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.\"Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996. Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted. Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape. Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion. There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas. In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted. A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a \"very unhappy man\".\"I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,\" Tally Evans said.\"I never saw my social worker again.\"The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart. Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: \"Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.\""}

A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.\"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\"Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague."}

Hanbury exploited a massive gap in the Warrington defence to go over and Flynn scored the home side's third try, after Stef Marsh's flick pass out of the back door created the opportunity. The Vikings' 16-0 half-time lead was extended when Phelps finished off Flynn's weaving run.

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report."}

Am I right?If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online:Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.\"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says.\"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\"Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.\"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker.\"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\"The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, i Phone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral. de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\"He was a great communicator.\"Sounds like a seal of approval to me."}

Sir Roger talks about how a dialogue coach helped boost his confidence, which helped him forge his career. Turning Points has been made for London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event. The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world. Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction. It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life. Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: \"It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).\"\"I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.\"Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English. They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'\"He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'\"I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?\"\"He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.\"He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.\"He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'. And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\"There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.\"It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,\" added Tally Evans.\"There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.\"Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996. Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted. Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape. Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion. There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas. In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted. A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a \"very unhappy man\".\"I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,\" Tally Evans said.\"I never saw my social worker again.\"The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart. Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: \"Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.\""}

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U. S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U. S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U. S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U. S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U. S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote."}

Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don\u2019t think she\u2019s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she\u2019s probably doing that advisably, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019 Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a \u2018shop window mannequin\u2019 and a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess who has been \u2018designed by committee\u2019. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn\u2019t have a \u2018single opinion\u2019 of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate \u2018unambitious and bland\u2019."}

The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world. Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction. It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life. Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: \"It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).\"\"I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.\"Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English. They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'\"He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'\"I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?\"\"He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.\"He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.\"He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'. And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\"There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.\"It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,\" added Tally Evans.\"There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.\"Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996. Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted. Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape. Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion. There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas. In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted. A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a \"very unhappy man\".\"I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,\" Tally Evans said.\"I never saw my social worker again.\"The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart. Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: \"Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.\""}

This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her world title.\"She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use,\" Minichiello said. Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two-year ban, backdated to 22 June 2013. It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before  she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points, beating defending champion Ennis-Hill's 6,751. Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken. Minichiello wants athletics' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to have a \"long, hard look\" at the Russian anti-doping agency's punishment. The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action.\"Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test,\" added Minichiello.\"I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.\"Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\"It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,\" said Minichiello.\"That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.\"Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences. Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash."}

'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off.

'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship\u2019s operation in any way.\u00a0Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore and more passengers have been recounting their wild ride. 'It\u2019s not pleasant, it\u2019s been like this all night,' one woman told ABC radio. 'I don\u2019t think many people got much sleep.' Carnival Cruise Lines officials confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carnival Spirit was scheduled to arrive 'early this morning' but was unable to do so because of the rough seas. 'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours.

'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney."}

War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are \"volunteers\".

There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.\"The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn):Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine?BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But they failed to galvanise protests against him."}

Campbell has been bailed pending further inquiries.", "article": "Stuart Campbell was arrested in the west of England on Friday following a complaint from a woman in south London. She had made allegations of harassment taking place over a two-year period. Mr Campbell, who was released on bail, said it concerned some tweets and insisted they were not threatening.  He accused the media of \"innuendo\" designed to encourage \"speculations\". The blogger, a former computer games reviewer who was born in Stirling but lives in Bath, has been a vocal campaigner for Scottish independence and launched the Wings Over Scotland blog in 2011. On Friday he tweeted that he would be posting less frequently than usual because of \"reasons totally outwith my control (don't ask)\". End of Twitter post  by @Wings Scotland A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: \"Police are investigating an allegation of online harassment.\"The allegation was made after a woman, aged in her 30s, attended a south London police station. The harassment is said to have taken place over the past two years.\"Mr Campbell has been bailed, pending further inquiries, to a date in mid-September. In a statement on the Wings Over Scotland website, Mr Campbell responded to a report of his arrest which appeared in The Herald newspaper. He said that piece \"has been written for maximum innuendo to allow the wildest speculations on social media - which are of course duly taking place - but the alleged events relate entirely to some tweets from our Twitter account, none of which have been deleted and all of which are still publicly visible.\"Nothing more sinister or serious than some tweets has occurred or been alleged to have occurred. None of the tweets involved are in ANY way threatening, not even in a joking sense. That's all we'll be saying on the subject at this time.\""}

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies"}

Am I right?If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online:Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.\"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says.\"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\"Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.\"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker.\"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\"The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, i Phone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.\"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says.\"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.\"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.\"You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral. de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.\"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.\"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\"However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious\". After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah. It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.\"We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,\" says founder Roald Lidal.\"One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,\" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.\"There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.\"As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.\"I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,\" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.\"The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.\"\"Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,\" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.\"He was a great communicator.\"Sounds like a seal of approval to me."}

Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don\u2019t think she\u2019s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she\u2019s probably doing that advisably, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019 Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a \u2018shop window mannequin\u2019 and a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess who has been \u2018designed by committee\u2019. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn\u2019t have a \u2018single opinion\u2019 of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate \u2018unambitious and bland\u2019."}

The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: \u2018True compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance.\u2019 He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning \u00a387 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not \u2018playing the system\u2019 but were \u2018victims of it\u2019. He said they were \u2018victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers\u2019. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net \u2013 not a web from which no-one could escape. \u2018So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. \u2018It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don\u2019t you dare lecture us on poverty. \u2018And know this \u2013 the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.\u2019 Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. \u2018For many second earners, work didn\u2019t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. \u2018In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That\u2019 s right \u2013 30 hours of free childcare a week \u2013 worth \u00a35,000 to working families. \u2018That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year \u2013 nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs \u2013 all by 2017.\u2019 Mr Cameron also argued \u2018that true compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance\u2019. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage.

In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague."}

On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.\"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.\"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\"Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.\"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses. If Russia fails to prosecute anyone, it says it will file a case at the International Criminal Court in The Hague."}

The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent."}

Sir Roger talks about how a dialogue coach helped boost his confidence, which helped him forge his career. Turning Points has been made for London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event. The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world. Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night. Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction. It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life. Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: \"It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).\"\"I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.\"Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English. They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'\"He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'\"I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?\"\"He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.\"He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.\"He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'. And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.\"There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.\"It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,\" added Tally Evans.\"There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.\"Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996. Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted. Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape. Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion. There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas. In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.

The idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him .  Online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of .", "article": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email."}
